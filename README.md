Description:

This repository contains all the programs developed for my master thesis on *Quantum Arithmetical Chaos*. To use the programs it is necessary to have installed **Python** and **FreeFem++**, which are two free and useful language programs. We refer to their documentation for details. 
******************************************
Inside the folder 'Codes' there are the Python and FreeFem++ programs:
- in the 'Python folder' you can find two subfolders, 'Billiards' and 'Quantum Euclidean Eigenfunctions':
    1. Billiards:
        here you can find programs to simulate billiards. In each program, there are mainly two scenes, a simulation with one or two particles (Draw_single) or with many particles (Draw_multiples). To use them, use standard commands from manim library (e.g. `$ manim -qh -p filename.py Class`)
    2. Quantum Euclidean Eigenfunctions: 
        two programs to get the eigenvalues and plotting eigenfunctions on Bunimovich stadium and Cardioid
